 Hi there!

In this blog, I'll be blogging about my life as a remote web developer, the challenges I daily face, and I'll also write some technical articles as well.

The reason why I chose to use a personal blog instead of using a large platform such as Medium, is that I don't feel like posting for a large base of audience, if I did that would be pressuring, and I would start worrying about how people might react to the content of the posts. Also, I'm not sure that my content will be that interesting anyways.

So, I hope that you enjoy reading the upcoming posts. Talk to you soon! :)
