title: Learning Node, Express, and Mongo

I've finished my last exam on Wednesday, and I've been studying the [Node.js Coursera Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development) since then. A class that I've failed to complete multiple times over the last couple of months; due to the pressure imposed on me by the university and the work I had to complete in my free time. So, now seems the perfect time to finish this course, to help me transition into a full-stack developer position as I've always planned.

## What I've learned so far
So far I'm in week 3 of the 4 weeks' MOOC, and I've learned about the following concepts:

- I learned how to create simple Node modules, and import them into other modules, to create a modular Node code.
- I also learned about [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and how to set up a basic server using it.
- Then I learned about MongoDB, and I really enjoyed the flexibility of the NoSQL DBs, it's a lot more flexible and scalable than the SQL DBs that I've dealt with in the past. [Here's the code I wrote for that](https://github.com/amrsekilly/CRUD-MongoDB).
- After that I learned about [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), and how to use it to impose a schema and a model on the collections in the MongoDB. [Here's the code I wrote for that](https://github.com/amrsekilly/confusion-schemas).
- Then I connected the Express server written earlier to the Mongoose models, to create a fully functional RESTful APIs. [Here's the code I wrote for that](https://github.com/amrsekilly/confusion-rest-apis).

## What's next
Next, I'll be learning about:
- Basic user authentication.
- Cookies, and Express Sessions.
- Using [Passport](passportjs.org) to authenticate users using their social media accounts.
- HTTPS and secure communication.
- Backend as a service.
- And I'll finish that course by integrating the AngularJS/[ionic](https://github.com/amrsekilly/ConFusion-iOS-Android) app I've constructed in the past with the newly created backend.

## How soon I'll finish this
I think if I kept learning with the same pace I'm going now, I might be able to finish this by next Friday. Anyway, I'm more focused on learning the concepts behind everything in that course more than finishing it quickly, as I don't have an actual CS background, and most of the concepts taught here are new to me. That's why I think that understanding the meaning behind everything we do in this course is more important than following the instructions in building the app. I find it also important to read the external resources provided after each module, that helps me learn more about the tools and frameworks we are using in a more general sense, instead of just understanding the basics taught for the purpose of completing the restaurant app that we're building in this course.

## What's next
After finishing that course, I'll now have backend knowledge, and I'll have developed a fully functional restaurant web/hybrid app. So, I might also build a couple of demos one using MEAN, and the other using MERN; to refresh my memory on both Angular and React.

After that I'll continue working, and freelancing. Also, I'll continue working on a side project that I've been working on in hopes of having a working demo before startup weekend this year.

Cheers! :)
