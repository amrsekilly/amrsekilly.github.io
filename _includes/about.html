                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <p>I study Electrical Engineering in <a href="#">Alexandria University, EG</a>. But mainly I'm interested in web development and I'm working on becoming a full-stack JavaScript web developer;
                  by enrolling in <a href="#">Coursera Specializations</a>, working on real life projects as a freelancer, building projects on <a href="#">Free Code Camp</a>
                  , and <a href="#">peer programming</a> with friends from all over the world!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  P.S. I program robots that dive and discover underwater... which is pretty cool!
